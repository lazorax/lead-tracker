<h1>Lead-tracker</h1>
<p>
Lead Tracker is a simple browser extension for saving and organizing web links (leads). Users can add URLs manually by typing, save the current browser tab instantly using the "Save Tab" button, or use the regular "Save" button for any entered link. Optionally, a custom name can be given to each link through a prompt—this is completely optional. The app supports easy link management: double-tap the "❌" button next to any item to delete it individually, or double-tap the "Delete All" button to clear the entire list in one go. Perfect for keeping track of useful resources, articles, or any links you don’t want to lose.
